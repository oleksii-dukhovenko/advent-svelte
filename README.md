# SvelteKit Advent Challenge: Personal Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal project repository where I'm exploring and learning SvelteKit through the [SvelteKit Advent Challenges](https://advent.sveltesociety.dev/). This project is a hands-on approach to understanding the intricacies of SvelteKit by participating in a series of stimulating and educational challenges.

## 🌟 About the SvelteKit Advent Challenges

The SvelteKit Advent Challenges are a set of tasks designed to enhance one's skills in SvelteKit, a popular framework for building high-performance web applications. Each challenge focuses on a different aspect of SvelteKit, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

This repository contains my solutions and approaches to each challenge. The project is structured to reflect the progression through the challenges, with each challenge residing in its dedicated directory.
